I updated the libfgz to allow reading from standard in.

Makefile now supports Intel's ifort via COMPILER=ifort flag.

eg.  make SIZE=32 COMPILER=ifort 

More work is necessary to make this better but this is a start!


===============================================================

Carchia 1/24/2010

Makefile now supports gfortran via COMPILER=gnu flags.

eg.  make SIZE=32 COMPILER=gnu 


===============================================================
Carchia 1/15/2010

Modified makefile to build either a 32bit version or a 64bit
version of the library.

This can be selected by either:

make SIZE=32

or 

make SIZE=64

Modified to add gztell, gzseek, and gzflush interfaces.

Original README below.

ilibfgz 0.2 - The Fortran part of the interface to read gzipped files
===============================================================

Compile the library with the command:

make

Your program can now be compiled with:

f77 [program.f] -L. -lfgz -lz

I am very grateful for the developers of SIMDET, from which I stole these
routines. Their website can be found on:

http://thalia.ifh.de/lc_repository/detector_simulation/dev/SIMDET/

A separate manual has not been written, but (I think) enough documentation
can be found in the Fortran source files of this library.

The library has been tested (and worked) on Linux, SunOS 32 and 64 bits.

Good luck with it, and let me know if you find this useful/waste of sweat or
if you have some great ideas, problems, etc.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The routines listed above
are subroutines for Brookhaven Protein Data Bank record I/O
and are available in the pdb library, typically
.IR "-L/usr/local/lib/midas -lpdb" .
.PP
Although the header file is too long to reproduce here, it should be
perused before using any of the above routines.
It is typically found in
.IR /usr/local/midas/include .
\fBpdb_read_record\fP reads the next line of input from the file \fBf\fP,
and returns the contents parsed into a C structure.
\fBpdb_parse\fP parses the contents of the line buffer
and returns a C structure.
\fBpdb_write_record\fP writes the contents of the PDB record (\fB*r\fP) to 
the file \fBf\fP.  If the \fBname\fP is non-null, then it and the line
number given (\fBline_num\fP) are placed in columns 72 through 80 on the
line in standard PDB format.
.PP
\fBpdb_read_record\fP and \fBpdb_write_record\fP automatically
handle versions 5 and 6 of the UCSFCGL's PDB scene annotation records.
The version number is automatically changed when a USER  PDBRUN record is read
or written.
Any other version number turns off the parsing of scene annotation records.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Upon reaching the end of the file, \fBpdb_read_record\fP will return
a record with PDB_END as its type.
.SH NOTES
The subtype field of USERxx structure tells what the \fIxx\fP part was.
The rest of the line, up to the card sequence portion, is the text field.
.PP
Due to the way Brookhaven encodes their files,
atom names usually have leading blanks and sometimes have embedded blanks.
Residue names occasionally have leading blanks too.
To be entirely consistent with the PDB format, the programmer should put those
blanks in before using \fBpdb_write_record\fP.
.SH BUGS
Doesn't allow exact duplication of the PDB card image sorting field
(columns 73 through 80).
.PP
Routines are needed to convert to and from PDB typesetting conventions
in COMPND, SOURCE, AUTHOR, and JRNL records.

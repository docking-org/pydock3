.SH DESCRIPTION
The routines listed above
are subroutines for Molecular Surface record I/O
and are available in the pdb library, typically
.IR "-L/usr/local/lib/midas -lpdb" .
.PP
Although the header file is too long to reproduce here, it should be
perused before using any of the above routines.
It is typically found in
.IR /usr/local/midas/include .

and returns the contents parsed into a C structure.
\fBms_parse\fP parses the contents of the line buffer
and returns a C structure.
\fBms_write_record\fP writes the contents of the MS record (\fB*m\fP) to 
the file \fBf\fP.

Description:

	DMS is "Distributed MS", a version of the solvent-accessible
	surface computation program.  This version splits the
	computation into independent units and executes each unit on a
	dms server which runs somewhere on the local area network.

	Dms is distributed as open source, subject to the legal
	restrictions noted at the end of this file.

	Consult the dms manual page (dms.1) for details on usage.

Prerequisites:

	You need GNU make and a C compiler to build this software.
	When we refer to the "make" command below, you should use
	the actual GNU make executable file name.  On Linux and
	Cygwin, the GNU make executable is called "make".  On IRIX,
	the GNU make executable is part of the free software installed
	in /usr/freeware/bin and is called "gmake".

	This software has been built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
	and on Windows XP Professional with Cygwin.

Installation:

	Edit "GNUmakefile" and change LIBDIR and BINDIR to the
	appropriate location for your system.

	At this point, you could get away with typing "make install"
	and be done.  You may or may not want to do the following
	before that:

	Edit the file "dms_param.h" and set the appropriate
	parameters to the desired values.  You may need to twiddle with
	the last few parameters if you want to get the optimal performance.

	By default, dms runs on the local host only, instead of running
	in parallel on multiple hosts.  If this behavior is sufficient
	for your needs, type "make install" and stop here.  Otherwise...

	Edit the file "dms_servers.proto" to contain a list of hosts that
	will run dms servers.  All machines participating in a single dms
	calculation must be binary compatible with the machine initiating
	the calculation.  For sites with multiple machine architectures,
	this may mean that there are several distinct "pools" of dms
	servers, for calculations initiated by a machine within a pool.
	Now type "make install".

	Dms must be installed as above on each server machine, and on each
	such machine the following steps must be performed as root:

	1) Register the 'dms' service on the host.  On most UNIX systems
	this is done by editing /etc/services and adding the following
	line:
		dms 14148/tcp
	
	On Mac OS X systems, instead execute the following command:

		echo dms 14148/tcp | niload services .
	
	2) Add this line to /etc/inetd.conf:

		dms stream tcp nowait daemon dmsd_location dmsd
	
	where 'dmsd_location' is where dmsd is installed.  (If you
	didn't change the Makefile at all, then the location is
	/usr/local/lib/dms/dmsd)

	3) Make the inetd daemon reread the inetd.conf file.  This is
	accomplished by sending the inetd process a HUP signal.  In
	order to send the signal, you need to know inetd's process ID.
	The process ID can be found by examining the output of 'ps agx'
	or 'ps -e' (depending on your system).  The rightmost column
	contains the process name, so look for the line that includes
	'inetd' somewhere in the righthand column.  On that line, in
	the 'PID' column, is inetd's process ID.  The signal is then 
	sent with the command:

		kill -HUP process_ID
	
	After performing the above steps on all servers, you should 
	verify that dms is indeed performing distributed computations
	as expected.  To do this, you need to have a PDB file available
	to use as a test input (preferably a small one).  Once you do,
	run the command:

		dms your_PDB_file -v -o /dev/null
	
	If you have correctly installed dms for distributed computation,
	the output will contain a line of the form:

		Server request count:

	followed by a list of hosts that dms ran on to do the calculation,
	and the amount of calculation that each host performed.  If the
	list of servers is what you expect, and no calculation count is
	zero, then you have installed dms correctly.  If one or more
	calculation counts are zero then you did not install dms correctly
	on those hosts.  For those problem hosts you should verify that
	the above steps were carried out correctly as well as insuring
	that dmsd is installed in the correct location and is executable.  
	If your list of server hosts is not what you expect and is simply
	'localhost' instead, the you have not correctly completed step (1)
	on the local machine.

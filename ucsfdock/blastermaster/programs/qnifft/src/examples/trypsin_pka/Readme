Qnifft11 example- calculating shift in pKa of His 40 in rat trypsin

execute trypsin.com

The results are in *.log and *.fld files

Numbers needed for pKa calculation have been pulled out into trypsin.sum file:

=========================
Neutral HIs40 in water
=========================
tryp0_hisn.log: Interaction of source charges with themselves (kT)   37.41749    

=========================
Protonated HIs40 in water
=========================
tryp0_hisp.log: Interaction of source charges with themselves (kT)   55.29925    

=========================
Neutral His40 in protein, protein initially uncharged- then charged for
analysis
=========================
tryp_hisn.log: Interaction of source charges with themselves (kT)   39.29287    
tryp_hisn.log: Interaction between source and target charges (kT)  -8.098629    

=========================
Protonated HIs40 in protein, protein initially uncharged- then charged for
analysis
=========================
tryp_hisp.log: Interaction of source charges with themselves (kT)   74.60247    
tryp_hisp.log: Interaction between source and target charges (kT)  -25.44155    

Change in solvation dG of charged His40 due to protein 74.6 - 55.3 = 19.3 kT
Change in solvation dG of neutral His40 due to protein 39.3 - 37.4 = 1.9  kT
Net solvation contribution to pKa shift: (1.9 - 19.3)/2.303 = -7.64 pK units
Change in interaction of His with protein charges upon de-protonation:
-8.1 - -25.4 = +17.3 kT = +7.5 pK units
Net pKa shift -7.64 + 7.5 = -0.14 = 0 within error (+/- about 1kT or 1/2.303 pK typical)

The *.fld files list the charge, potential and field on an atom by
atom basis. the utility program sums q.phi for each residue, so one
can analyse strength of interaction between source and target charges
on a residue by residue basis. Looking at the output of this, in the
*.int file, we see that most of the interaction is between his 40
and Asp 84 of the catalytic triad.

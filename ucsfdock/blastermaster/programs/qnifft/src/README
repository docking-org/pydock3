This is a macromolecular electrostatics program based on finite difference
solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann eqn. It is an outgrowth of 
the DelPhi macromolecular electrostatics software. 

In any published work using this program, please cite to the appropriate references

The core program is QNIFFT22 
(Q for charge, N for non-linear, 22 for version 2.2)
An older version, 14. is included for 'safety'

The major changes in version 2.2

*Reads EITHER a *.atm file with coords, charge and radii record (output from a previous qnifft run or created
  by some other program)(set input=t)
  OR a pdb file plus a radius parameter file and charge parameter file

*Less memory usage- grid sizes upto 191 cubed can run on typical linux boxes
*A more accurate, essentially scale independent surface generation algorithm (fast=f)
  which is however quite slow to generate for large molecules, especially with cavities and rugged surface
*Calculates solvent forces

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It differs from the DelPhi versions distributed under license from Barry Honig
and Columbia University, and by Biosym, primarily in the format of the input
(see the delphi.def file and *.lis files)
and the analysis of results (see the programs ionint and ionintm). 
It has been developed for 
academic research purposes by Kim Sharp, Dept. of Biochemistry, 
University of Pensylvania. It is distributed free of charge to
academic researchers, and due to my extremely limited resources, I
cannot provide support. It is not intended to be a substitute
for either the Columbia or Accelerys versions of DelPhi, which
come with support (at a price).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is assumed that you are familiar
with unix, and the basic concepts of macromolecular electrostatics
as described in references below.



To compile the delphi program QNIFFT22 and the two utility programs
IONINTM (for nonlinear PB analysis) and CHKCHG (checks net charge
on each residue using *.atm output from QNIFFT22 (with site=t
parameter set):

1) Modify Makefiles in source/utility and source/qnifft/v2.2 directory
 to match your compiler name and flags. Examples are given for SGI, linux/G77 and compaq

2) Run Install.com

Install.com will compile three qnifft22 executables with max grids of 65, 129 and 161
named qnifft22_65 qnifft22_129 and qnifft22_161
respectively- use the 65 grid version for small systems, and to produce potential
maps that can be read into grasp.  Larger versions can use smaller grid sizes up to max,
but produce large files which cannot be read by GRASP.
Install.com will temporarily define an environment variable DELDIR pointing to this
directory- executables are put in $DELDIR/bin. you should
permanently define this variable (DELDIR) in your login file so you can
run programs, and put $DELDIR/bin in your path.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install.com will compile the utility programs:
ionintm:   	Does non-linear PB energy analysis- see dna-drug example
		reads default qnifft22 output with grid size 65 unless modified and recompiled
sumfld:  	finds sum(q.phi) over residues in *.fld file output from qnifft
		 or average phi for each residue- useful for getting s-b-components of interaction energy
chkchg: 	sums assigned atomic charge over residues- reads the *.atm output from qnifft (which is a pdb 
		file with radius, charge in occupancy and B-factor fields).  VERY useful for checking that 
		you have assigned charge correctly
qequil_pdb:	Uses the charge equilibration by equalization of electronegativity method of Rappe & Goddard
		to give approximate atomic charges- read in a pdb file, outputs a *.atm file that can be read 
		into qnifft22- useful for quick generation of charges for new functional groups/cofactors
		not been tested! 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no manual! Learning is by example.
QNIFFT22 will give help on parameters- type:

qnifft22_65 help
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are examples in the directory examples, & various readme files
It is strongly suggested that you work through all examples, to learn
how program is controlled, format of input files, and analysis of results.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sample Charge and radius input files are in the data directory.
The charge file in particular is usually heavily modified for
each application, as illustrated by the examples, so as to
assign charge to the required molecule of fragment for potential
calculation or analysis.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: it is important to check your charge assignments carefully- 
this is the source of many beginner errors- usually a mismatch between
atom names (especially hydrogens) in the *.crg and *.pdb files
there are several things to help you here: the net charge printed in the logfile,
the *.atm file output, with the assigned radii/charge in the occupancy/B-factor field
(set atomfile_output=t), and chkchg (chkchg < myfile.atm > check.out)
which prints net charge per group.  usually these will identify the problem
